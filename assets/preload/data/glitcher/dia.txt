:bf/13:Huff.. puff... wow we spent a whole day on this.
:bf:Aren't you tired?
:hex:Nope! Not yet at least.
:hex:My battery is solar-based so i'm saving energy at nights!
:bf:Pff, lucky you then.

:bf/18:H-Huh? Hex?
:hex:...Uh oh.
:hex:I think we might have a problem...
:bf:What problem?
:hex/19:I probably used too much processing power and let my guard down...
:hex:Something might have passed by my defenses, which means...
:hex/20:There might be a virus inside me.
:gf:Huh? Wait, isn't that like, dangerous to machines?
:hex:VERY dangerous.... oh no.
:hex/21:I think it wants to take control over the system.
:bf:Shoot... can't you do something to prevent that?
:hex:I... don't think i can... but.
:hex:Wait. Maybe you can.
:bf/22:Huh?
:hex:Grab my mic and fight that thing off!
:hex:If you order the system to input enough mic patterns it might crash.
:hex:Then i'll enter sleep mode and run a safety scan which will kill that thing.
:hex/23:Please! You're my only hope right now!
:bf:...
:bf/24:...Alright Hex, i'll try. I'm not leaving you behind.
:bf:Are you ready?
:hex/25:...
:hex/26:...I'm always ready.
